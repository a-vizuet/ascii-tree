# ascii-tree
My attempt tt building an ascii-tree in Rust.

It search deep into the directories and builds the proper string recursively.

Based on 4chan /g/ programming challenges.
It worked to refresh my mind about Rust, what a cool language, and also to improve my skills. Now I understand rust better.
